Repository for the Paper:
“Learning-based Link Prediction Methods Integrating Network Topological Features and Embedding Representations”
arXiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06677


## Overview

This repository provides the official implementation of all methods, experiments, and datasets used in our paper. It includes:

### TELP (Topology- and Embedding-based Link Prediction)

Complete source code for the TELP ensemble model

Reproducible training, validation, and evaluation scripts

Utilities for topological feature construction, embedding generation, and metric computation

### Baseline Algorithms

Implementations and experiment scripts for all benchmarked link-prediction baselines reported in the paper

Includes both heuristic methods and embedding-based models

### Nine Benchmark Datasets

All datasets used in the paper are included in the /data/ directory

Each dataset follows the same preprocessing pipeline described in the published experiments
